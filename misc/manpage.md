kadnode(1) - P2P name resolver daemon
====================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kadnode`  [--announce \<domain\>] [--daemon] [...]

`kadnode-ctl`  [...]

## DESCRIPTION

**KadNode** is a small P2P DNS resolver. It supports authentication based on x509 certificates and public key queries as base32 and hexadecimal strings.

## JOIN THE SWARM

KadNode needs to know at least one active peer to join / bootstrap into the swarm.
There are three ways to achieve this:

1. Provide one or more peers to the command line arguments. These could be public BitTorrent trackers, or other KadNode instances:
```
kadnode --peer bttracker.debian.org --peer 192.168.1.1
```

2. Ping a peer using the KadNode console if present:
```
kadnode-ctl ping bttracker.debian.org
```

3. Use the local peer discovery feature. Just start KadNode and it will try to discover other KadNode nodes in the local network.


Also provide a `--peerfile` argument to let KadNode load its peerlist on startup and store on every 24h and shutdown.
This ensures successful bootstrapping on next startup.


## AUTHENTICATION

KadNode provides two authentication schemes. One works via x509 certificates and TLS. The other one uses raw secret/public keys and is hence called bob.

### Via TLS

Typically there are two KadNode instances involved.

One node announces a domain, e.g. mynode.p2p. The other node looks for the IP address of the announcing node. Authentication happens via TLS, which in turn uses X509 certificates.

```
kadnode --announce mynode.p2p --tls-server-cert mynode.crt,mynode.key
```

As an alternative, ownership can be proven using an HTTPS server running on the same host.
In this case, KadNode itself does not need certificates, but needs to announce the HTTPS port:

```
kadnode --announce mynode.p2p:443
```

The other node doing the lookup for mynode.p2p needs to have access to the root certificate that has been used to sign mynode.crt. These can be a common web browsers certificates:

```
kadnode --tls-client-cert /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla
```

Own certificates authorities can be created and used, of course.

Note: `--announce` is optional in many cases as domains from certificate and key files are announced automatically.

### Via BOB

First create an elliptic curve secret key file:

```
kadnode --bob-create-key mysecretkey.pem
Generating secp256r1 key pair...
Public key: c492192ac20144ed2a43d57e7239f5ef5f6bb418a51600980e55ff565cc916a4
Wrote secret key to mysecretkey.pem
```

Now make the secret key load on KadNode startup:
```
kadnode --bob-load-key mysecretkey.pem
```

Any reachable node can now resolve c492192ac20144ed2a43d57e7239f5ef5f6bb418a51600980e55ff565cc916a4.p2p to the IP address of the announcing host. There is no need to share any additional information beforehand.

## No Authentication

KadNode also allows to just lookup a hexadecimal string and to get IP addresses as return.
This is the plain use of the DHT. The hexadecimal string will be cut down or filled up with zeros internally to fit the size the DHT uses (currently 20 bytes).

### KadNode Console Commands

When not started in background, KadNode accepts a variety of commands from standard input.

  * `status`  
    Print the node id, the number of known nodes / searches / stored hashes and more.

  * `lookup` *domain*  
    Lookup the IP addresses of all nodes that claim to satisfy the domain.  
    The first call will start the search.

  * `announce` [*domain*[<i>:*port*</i>] [<i>*minutes*</i>]]  
    Announce that this instance is associated with a domain  
    and an optional port. The default port is random (but not equal 0).  
    A missing *minutes* argument trigger a single announcement. Negative *minutes*  
    last for the entire runtime. Otherwise the lifetime is set *minutes* into the future.  
    No arguments will announce all identifiers at once.

  * `import` *addr*  
    Send a ping to another KadNode instance to establish a connection.

  * `export`  
    Print a few good nodes.

  * `list` [`blacklist`|`buckets`|`constants`|`forwardings`|`results`|`searches`|`storage`|`values`]  
    List various internal data structures.

  * `blacklist` *addr*  
    Blacklist a specific IP address.

## KadNode External Console

KadNode allows a limited set of commands to be sent from any user from other consoles.

`kadnode-ctl` [-p path] [status|lookup|announce|import|export|blacklist]

  * `-p` *path*  
    Unix socket used to connect to the command shell of a local KadNode instance (Default: /tmp/kadnode.sock).

  * `-h`  
    Print this help.

## Name Service Switch (NSS)

Kadnode can intercept system-wide DNS lookups via NSS. This is need to be able to use kadnode links in the web browser or for command line tools like ssh. For this, `/etc/nsswitch.conf` need to be configured:

  * Copy libnss_kadnode.so.2 to /lib/. Other libnss_*.so files are likely to be there as well.
  * Edit `/etc/nsswitch.conf` to include `kadnode` in the `hosts:` line before entry `dns`:
    * `hosts: kadnode dns`

## Automatic Port Forwarding

If KadNode runs on a computer in a private network, it will try to establish a port forwarding for the DHT port and ports used for announcements.
Port forwarding only works if UPnP/NAT-PMP is compiled into KadNode and is supported by the gateway/router.
This is useful to make a local service (e.g. a web server) reachable from the Internet without the need to
configure port forwardings manually.
