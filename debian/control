Description: A P2P based DNS service
 This tool translates hostnames to IPv6/IPv4 addresses
 using P2P technology. Every user can announce
 various hostnames and can resolve these hostnames
 on other computers running KadNode.
 KadNode wraps the Kademlia DHT implementation
 and offers support for the Name Service Switch (NSS)
 facility. The package also includes a control program
 called kadnode-ctl.
